        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
          The anglicization of Kashmir into &quot;Cashmere&quot; in the 19th
          century marked the beginning of a strategic and ongoing exploitation
          of Kashmir&apos;s rich cultural heritage. British colonial powers,
          recognizing the global allure of Kashmir&apos;s craft and craftmanship,
          deliberately rebranded it as &quot;Cashmere&quot;, stripping away its
          cultural significance to make it more marketable in Europe and beyond.
          This was not merely a linguistic change, but a calculated move in an
          economic war to control and profit from Kashmir&apos;s ancient
          craftsmanship. By detaching the product from its origins, Britain
          paved the way for mass production and industrialization in Europe,
          diluting the exclusivity and authenticity of Kashmiri Craft. What
          followed was a flood of machine-made imitations that undermined the
          value of the original craft, effectively launching a long-term battle
          for market dominance that continues today.

        <p className="text-base leading-relaxed sm:text-lg md:text-xl">
          In the modern era, this war has found a new player <strong>China</strong>. Now
          the world&apos;s largest producer of &quot;Cashmere&quot;, China
          capitalizes on the confusion created by the original anglicization,
          mass-producing synthetic and cheaper product that is marketed under
          the same label. As a result, Kashmiri artisans are once again
          marginalized, battling against a global market saturated with inferior
          products under the &quot;Cashmere&quot; name. This ongoing struggle,
          rooted in colonial exploitation, has become a war over identity,
          authenticity, and survival. While foreign powers profit from the
          legacy of Kashmiri Crafts, the true artisans continue to fight to
          reclaim their heritage and secure their rightful place in the global
          market.
